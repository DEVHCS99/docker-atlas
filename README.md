Apache Atlas Docker image
=======================================

This `Apache Atlas` is built from the 2.0.0-release source tarball and patched to be run in a Docker container.

Atlas is built `with embedded HBase + Solr` and it is pre-initialized (atlas_start.py -setup), so you can run Artas after image download without additional steps.

If you want to use external Atlas backends, set them up according to [the documentation](https://atlas.apache.org/#/Configuration).

Basic usage
-----------
1. Pull the image:

```bash
docker pull sburn/apache-atlas
```

2. Start Apache Atlas in a container exposing Web-UI port 21000:

```bash
docker run --detach \
    -p 21000:21000 \
    --name atlas \
    sburn/apache-atlas \
    /opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/bin/atlas_start.py
```

Please, take into account that at fist run Atlas initialize internal schemas and startup may take up to 10 mins depending on host machine performance.

Usage options
-------------

Gracefully stop Atlas:

```bash
docker exec -ti atlas /opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/bin/atlas_stop.py
```

Check Atlas startup script output:

```bash
docker logs -f atlas 
```

Check interactively Atlas application.log:

```bash
docker exec -it atlas tail -f /opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/logs/application.log
```

Start Atlas overriding settings by environment variables 
(to support large number of metadata objects for example):

```bash
docker run --detach \
    -e "ATLAS_SERVER_OPTS=-server -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=0 -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=dumps/atlas_server.hprof -Xloggc:logs/gc-worker.log -verbose:gc -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=10 -XX:GCLogFileSize=1m -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps"
    -p 21000:21000 \
    --name atlas \
    sburn/apache-atlas \
    /opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/bin/atlas_start.py
```

Expose logs directory on the host to view them directly:

```bash
docker run --detach \
    -v ${PWD}/atlas-logs:/opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/logs \
    -p 21000:21000 \
    --name atlas \
    sburn/apache-atlas \
    /opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/bin/atlas_start.py
```

Expose conf directory on the host to edit configuration files directly:

```bash
docker run --detach \
    -v ${PWD}/pre-conf:/opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/conf \
    -p 21000:21000 \
    --name atlas \
    sburn/apache-atlas \
    /opt/apache-atlas-2.0.0/bin/atlas_start.py
```
